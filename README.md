# Methodology for making classification models for biological sequence data.
With the next generatin sequenceing technologies sequence data in biotechnology has grown exponentially. With this new vast amount of data it is important to know how to use this data effectivly.  While the volume of raw sequence data as increased, charictarised (labled) data has not increased the same way. Further more the labled data we do have is ofthen heavily unbalanced. It is impo

When evaluating classification/regression models for sequence data it is important to take the evolutionary nature of the data in to consideration. Since the evolutionary process will make the data points corrolate with one another. Thus one needs to correct for this when splitting the data.

## Principal component analysis and dimensionality reduction of embeddings

To visulise the embeddings of the sequences we can project the dat on to its princial components. This will alow us to view the linear representations of the data containing the most information. In figure 1 we have plotted the embedded data in the first two prinsiple components
