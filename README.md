With the next generatin sequenceing technologies sequence data in biotechnology has grown exponentially. With this new vast amount of data it is important to know how to use this data effectivly.  While the volume of raw sequence data as increased, charictarised (labled) data has not increased the same way. Further more the labled data we do have is ofthen heavily unbalanced. It is impo

When evaluating classification/regression models for sequence data it is important to take the evolutionary nature of the data in to consideration. Since the evolutionary process will make the data points corrolate with one another. Thus one needs to correct for this when splitting the data.
